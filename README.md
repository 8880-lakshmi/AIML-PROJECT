Student score analysis

A score distribution is a summary of how all student scores on an exam are spread out across a range of possible scores. The most common way to visualize this is with a histogram.

Objectives :- The goal of analyzing a score distribution is to turn a list of numbers into a powerful story about teaching, learning, and assessment.

1.Evaluate the Exam: To see if the test was fair, too easy, or too hard.

2.Assess Teaching: To understand if the instruction was effective for most students.

3.Support Students: To identify who needs extra help and who is ready for a challenge.

4.Improve Future Lessons: To find curriculum gaps and improve teaching methods.

Key Features:-

1.Center (Mean/Median): The typical or average student score.

2.Spread (Standard Deviation): How similar or different the scores were. A high spread means diverse performance.

3.Shape (Histogram): The visual pattern of the scores.

Normal (Bell Curve): A mix of high, average, and low scores. Ideal.

Skewed: Most students did very well (easy test) or very poorly (hard test).

Bimodal: Two distinct groups, suggesting a major learning gap.
